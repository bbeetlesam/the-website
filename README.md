# The Website, Pt. II

In the days of the early knowledge of Sam, he knew what the trend was at the time,
but instead of following it, he chose the counterpath. He decided to create a website
with plain language, without any tools or frameworks to help him.
He thought he knew what he was doing back then...\
until now, when he realized why those tools were invented by the savants.\
And, by looking at the project's result, we know that he wasn't satisfied with it.

So, he decided to tackle his old challenge one more time:\
to create his very own personal website, with his very own persona and his enigmatic behaviour.

And right now, you are looking at his project.

So, allow me to present to you,\
**Ladies and gentlemen,\
Damen und Herren,\
Mesdames et Messieurs.**

This, is the project of **The Website of Sam**.
