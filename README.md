# The Website

It's literally just a shitty website bruh, nothing interesting here.

Well, in case you didn't know, I already have my personal website, and it was made without any
single framework at all.\
Yes, I did that to push my limits, and unsurprisingly, the result looked so dreadful that even
my poop had more visual appeal than my site's interface and UI.

Over time (and with a few more brain cells activated), I’ve gained some knowledge and experience,
so I decided to rebuild the damn thing, now with actual structure, better performance, and maybe
a design that doesn’t cause eye cancer.

This one’s still shit, but hey, it’s at least 5% less shitty than the previous version.\
Enjoy, and don’t forget to poop while smoking a cigar, it’s a heavenly combo.
